## Description
 We're here to create a simple 2D game in which the player controls a bird that is flying through the air. The goal of the game is to fly as far as possible without hitting any obstacles or falling to the ground. In the game, the player makes the bird jump and avoid obstacles. The bird automatically falls to the ground with gravity. As the bird flies, the player scores points based on the distance traveled. The game ends when the bird collides with an obstacle or falls to the ground. The player's score is then displayed on the screen along with the option to restart the game.

## Technologies being used:
* Unity
* C#

## User stories:
* As a user, I would like my character to move through the game in a smooth motion.

* As a user, I would like to have obstacles to to have to avoid and move around.

* As as user, I would like to keep track of my score by distance traveled, or time spent.

* As a user, I would to be displayed when the game is over with an option to restart.

## Description of the user work flow:
Set up the project: Start by opening Unity and creating a new project. Choose the 2D template and give your project a name.

Design the game: You can use the Unity editor to create the environment for your game. You can add a background, obstacles, and a platform for the bird to land on. You can also add animations and sound effects to make the game more interactive.

Create the bird character: You can create a sprite for the bird and import it into your Unity project. You can also add animations and sounds to the bird to give it more personality.

Implement bird movement: You will need to use C# to implement the bird's movement imcluding making the bird jump.

Add obstacles: You can add obstacles to the game by creating sprite objects and placing them in the environment. You will need to use C# to detect when the bird collides with an obstacle and adjust the game accordingly.

Scoring system: You can create a scoring system by keeping track of the distance the bird travels. You will need to use C# to increment the score and display it on the screen.


Game Over: You will need to implement a game over condition that is triggered when the bird collides with an obstacle or falls off the platform. You will also need to display a game over screen and give the player the option to restart the game.


## Daily Sprints:
* Day 1: Get a better understanding on C# and the use of Unity.
* Day 2: Start implenting knowledge and build animations for game screen.
* Day 3: Build basics for functionaility.
* Day 4: Add scoreboard and restart game funtion.
* Day 5: Add design for the whole website.

## MVP's 
* Create a bird that can move around the screen.
* Create obstacles for the bird.
* Write functionaility so if the bird kills th e monster, move on to the next level.
* Render a game over screen, with an option to restart.
* Render a way to track score.
* Add music.
* Edit animations on the monster once killed.
* Give a two player option.

## General Approach:
Creating an Angry Birds knock off game with Unity and C# was a fun and challenging project. My first step was to do tons of research on Unity and C# because I had zero knowledge of either. Once I realized how they worked together, I planned out the game mechanics. I put together what objects I would like to have in the game, and how they will interact with each other. After creating the game characters and enviroment I added the physics to the game. The physics engine in Unity is powerful and can be used to create realistic interactions between objects. You will need to add physics to the game objects, including gravity, velocity, and collision detection. Once the game environment, characters, and physics are set up, you can implement the game mechanics.

## Unsolved Problems:
* Cycling from the last level to the "Play Again" screen.
* A way to keep score.
* Adding sound effects/ music.
* Two player option.
